## 👋 Hi, I’m @mrdimara

- 🎓Pursuing Electrical Engineering undergrad at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad
- 🔍 Passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Electric Vehicles**, and **Motor Control Systems**
- 🤖 Currently working on:
  - **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** for 3-phase and 5-phase induction motors in MATLAB Simulink
  - **EV subsystem design** for Formula Bharat (EV Team)
  - **Machine Learning**, with a focus on neural networks, unsupervised learning, and real-world applications
- 🧠 Also diving into **Competitive Programming** to improve problem-solving skills

### 🚀 Key Interests & Goals
- Embedded Systems & Edge AI (TinyML, STM32, TI C2000, Jetson Nano)
- Real-time Motor Control & Power Electronics
- Applied AI/ML in engineering systems
- Industrial safety systems, PCB design, and hardware-software integration

### 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
- MATLAB & Simulink | Python | C++ | Verilog | Arduino | Raspberry Pi | ESP32  
- Git & GitHub | Icarus Verilog + GTKWave | Jupyter | TensorFlow (basics)

### 🤝 I’m open to collaborate on:
- Machine Learning projects with real-world applications
- Motor control and simulation (e.g., FOC, SVPWM, EV drive systems)
- Embedded systems projects with hardware implementation

### 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I love building things from scratch—from control systems to learning algorithms. Exploring how code meets hardware is where I feel at home.
